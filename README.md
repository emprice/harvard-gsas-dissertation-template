Unofficial LaTeX template for Harvard GSAS theses
=================================================

If you find yourself struggling with formatting your dissertation, despair
not! This template is available for your use and follows the formatting
guidelines for GSAS, circa 2021. Always check the latest requirements, of
course --- the purpose of this repo is to get you started.

For the main content of the thesis document, I recommend creating a subdirectory
per chapter and then including each subdirectory's main LaTeX file. This avoids
name collisions and lets you include your published papers as chapters with very
little fuss.
